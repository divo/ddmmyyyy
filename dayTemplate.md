# Wake up
06:30 - 07:00
Start the day on the right foot. Upon waking, drink water and get moving with a brief activity (5–10 minutes of stretching, a short walk, or quick bodyweight exercises) to shake off sleepiness. This boosts your morning alertness and mood. Eat a balanced breakfast by 7 AM to fuel your brain (e.g. scrambled eggs with veggies and whole-grain toast, or Greek yogurt with fruit and nuts).

# Deep work block
07:00 - 9:00
This is prime time for most people’s focus – capitalize on it. Tackle your most mentally demanding or high-priority programming tasks first while your mind is fresh. Minimize distractions: close email, put your phone on do-not-disturb, and consider using a site blocker to prevent rabbit-holes with your “broad range of interests” during focus time. Work in a quiet environment or use noise-cancelling headphones if needed. You have caffeine on board (your first cup of coffee now), and after a good night’s rest, you can achieve a lot in these two hours.
- High priority task
- Do not disturb is on

# Short break
09:00 - 9:10
After about ~2 hours of work, take a breather. Breaks are essential to sustain concentration – top performers often work in ~50–90 minute sprints separated by breaks ￼. Stand up and stretch your legs. Give your eyes a rest from the screen (follow the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds). You might grab a glass of water or a light snack if you’re hungry. Avoid engaging in anything too distracting (don’t start browsing social media or news); the goal is to recharge without losing your mental momentum.
- Get some movement in

# Deep work block 2
09:10 - 11:00
Dive into the next coding task or project on your list. Late morning is still high-productivity time for many. If you feel your focus waning slightly, this is a good point to have your second cup of coffee (perhaps around 10 AM) to maintain your concentration level. Use caffeine strategically – a mid-morning dose can prolong your alertness into early afternoon without interfering with nighttime sleep (more on caffeine timing below). Continue to work with intense focus: if your mind wanders, gently bring it back to the task at hand. Remind yourself of the day’s goals and the “why” behind your work to stay motivated through this block.

# Micro-break
11:00 - 11:15
Take another short break to stay fresh. Get up from your desk, move around and perhaps do a quick household chore or take a step outside for fresh air. These little breaks help prevent mental fatigue and stiffness from sitting. Use this time to check in with yourself: How is your energy? Any creeping fatigue or distraction? Acknowledge it, and use the break to reset. This could also be a good time for a quick mindfulness exercise – e.g. close your eyes for 2 minutes and do deep breathing to clear your mind.

# Late morning push
11:15 - 12:00
Do a final push to wrap up the morning’s work. This might be a good time to finish a remaining task or review the code you’ve written in the morning. As you approach the midday break, try to reach a logical stopping point (complete a module or write down a plan for what’s next) so you can pause without anxiety. Knowing a break is coming can actually improve focus in this block – you can challenge yourself: “I have 1 hour to polish this feature before lunch.” Work with that sense of healthy urgency.

# Lunch and Exercise
12:00 - 13:00
Take a real break for lunch. Your brain and body need this pause. Step away from work completely. Eat a nutritious lunch that will energize your afternoon: for example, grilled fish or chicken (protein) with brown rice/quinoa (complex carb) and a salad or steamed veggies (fiber and nutrients). This balances blood sugar and avoids an afternoon crash ￼. Incorporate some movement here as well. You could do your planned run or a strength training session now if it fits (e.g. a 30-minute workout at 12:30, then a quick shower and 30 minutes to eat). Exercise at lunchtime can boost your mood and re-energize you for the second half of the day ￼. If a full workout isn’t feasible, even a 10-minute walk outside after eating can help digestion and give you a mental reset. The key is to return to work feeling refreshed.

# Early afternoon work block
13:00 - 15:00
Ease back into work with a slightly lighter task if you experience a post-lunch dip. Early afternoon is a common low-energy time as the body’s circadian rhythm fluctuates. To counter this, expose yourself to bright light (if indoors, turn on lights or sit by a window) and consider a small caffeine boost if needed. If you’re still feeling alert, you might not need more coffee yet; but if you feel sluggish, a cup of green tea or a half-cup of coffee around 2 PM can help maintain focus without disrupting your night sleep (make sure not to have caffeine much later than this) ￼. During this block, focus on tasks that are engaging to you – for example, coding a part of the project you find interesting or handling easier programming chores (writing tests, documentation, responding to code reviews). This can help you get back into flow. Use the “bite-sized task” approach to spark motivation: break your work into smaller chunks and tick them off one by one ￼. Each small win will give you a dopamine boost and keep you rolling through the afternoon.

# Energizing break
15:00 - 15:15
By mid-afternoon, definitely take another break. Step away from the computer and do something that invigorates you. Great options: a short walk outdoors (sunlight and movement are revitalizing), a quick stretch or yoga session to reverse the desk posture, or even a power nap if you’re extremely tired. A 15–20 minute power nap around this time can significantly recharge your brain, improving alertness and cognitive function for a couple hours ￼. (Set an alarm to avoid oversleeping, and don’t nap later than ~4 PM to ensure it doesn’t affect nighttime sleep.) If napping isn’t your thing, use the time for a healthy snack (e.g. a piece of fruit and some nuts) and perhaps a 5-minute mindfulness meditation to clear mental clutter. This break is like a reset button – you’ll tackle the late afternoon much better with this pause.

# Late afternoon work block & Caffenine Cut-Off
15:15 - 17:30
This period can be a second wind if you’ve rested properly. Refocus on work, aiming to complete the day’s remaining important tasks by 6 PM. Since you’ve been working many hours already, engage strategies to maintain focus: try the Pomodoro technique (e.g. 25-minute ultra-focused sprint, 5-minute break, repeat) if your mind is wandering, or change your work context slightly (for instance, move to a different room or stand at a standing desk for a while if possible). The change in posture or environment can help keep your brain alert ￼ ￼. This could also be a good time to do collaborative or less intellectually intense tasks, depending on your job – for instance, check in with teammates, reply to important emails, or do code reviews. Social interaction (even via chat) can give a little mental refresh during a long solo workday. However, if you’re in a deep flow on a project, by all means continue – just remember to give yourself mini-breaks each hour (even just standing and deep breathing for 30 seconds) to stave off fatigue.

# Dinner and Unwind
17:30 - 19:00
Take a long break for dinner. Just like lunch, completely detach from work during this time – mentally and physically. Eating a proper dinner will replenish you for the final part of your workday. Go for a meal with a good mix of protein and veggies, but a bit lighter on starchy carbs if you find they make you sleepy. For example, grilled tofu with vegetables stir-fry, or quinoa salad with beans and avocado. Avoid heavy, greasy foods at dinner; they can make you sluggish in the evening and are harder to digest. After dinner, do something relaxing for a little while – talk with a family member/roommate, play with a pet, or listen to some music. Giving yourself this hour to decompress a bit can prevent burnout. If you haven’t exercised yet and your energy is decent, a leisurely walk after dinner (even 10–15 minutes around the block) can aid digestion and lightly energize you for the evening stint.

# Evening work block (Wrap up)
19:00 - 21:00
Finish the workday strong, but also smart. Use this time to tie up loose ends: commit and push code changes, write down progress notes, and create tomorrow’s to-do list if you haven’t already. Resume work with lighter tasks or creative work that you enjoy. Acknowledge that energy and focus may not be as high as in the morning, so plan tasks accordingly. This is a great time for tasks that require creativity or strategic thinking in a relaxed way – some people actually get a second creative peak in the evening when the pressure of the day is off. The key is to stay engaged: if you feel boredom or monotony, switch to a different task or take a 5-minute break to reset. Continue using a cycle of focused work and short breaks (e.g. 45 minutes on, 5 minutes off) to keep your mind from fatiguing. Also, be mindful of your posture now – hours of sitting can take a toll. You might try working standing up for a bit or doing some chair stretches. Small actions like rolling your shoulders, twisting your torso, or stretching your neck can maintain physical comfort and focus.

# Short break
21:00 - 21:10
By this time, avoid any caffeine if you were considering an evening pick-me-up. You’ve likely had your last coffee by mid-afternoon; consuming caffeine now will interfere with your ability to fall asleep on time ￼. Instead, if you need a perk-up, do some quick movement – e.g. 20 jumping jacks or make yourself a cup of herbal tea (peppermint can be refreshing, chamomile if you’re looking to start calming down). Take 5–10 minutes to step away from work. This could be a good time to lightly plan tomorrow: jot down any pressing tasks or ideas in a notepad so you won’t worry about forgetting them overnight. Clearing your “mental RAM” in this way can reduce stress and also set you up for an organized tomorrow.

# Personal study
21:10 – 23:00
Be cautious about pushing yourself to do extremely complex problem-solving when you’re exhausted – mistakes and diminishing returns can creep in late at night. This can also be a time for learning/reading if your brain is too tired to produce but can still absorb. For instance, read an article or document related to your field that you’ve been meaning to, or watch a tech talk in the background. Mentally, this block should be about closure. Remind yourself that you’ve put in a massive effort today – far more than most – and every minute you work now is securing that “outworking everyone” goal. That said, monitor your fatigue: if you notice you’re making errors or just spinning wheels, it’s okay to call it a day a bit early. Pushing through when your brain is truly fried can lead to low-quality work and frustration ￼. It might be more effective to get extra sleep and start fresh in the morning. Discipline is key, but so is self-awareness.

# Shutdown and Sleep Routine
23:00 PM – 00:00 At 11, stop working. It’s crucial to set a firm cutoff so that work doesn’t bleed into your sleep time. Log off, physically step away from your workspace, and take a few minutes to acknowledge what you achieved today. This transition is important for your mind to switch out of work mode. Now begin your pre-sleep routine (as discussed in the Sleep section): dim the lights, maybe write in a journal or list 3 wins for the day, then do something relaxing (read, meditate, etc.). You want to be in bed around 11:30 to get enough sleep for the next day. Congratulate yourself – you just powered through a very demanding schedule! With practice, this structured day will start to feel more natural and you’ll build endurance.
- Wind-down routine before bed
- No screens 30 minutes before sleep
- Aim for 8 hours of quality sleep
